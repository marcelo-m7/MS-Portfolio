# Implementation Completion Plan

## Status: 90% Complete ✅

### What's Working
- ✅ Database schema (portfolio + public)
- ✅ Migrations applied (17/17)
- ✅ Data seeded (projects, artworks, series, thoughts, profile, contact)
- ✅ TypeScript types generated from Supabase
- ✅ Query layer refactored to use public views
- ✅ All components using generated types
- ✅ Contact form wired with RLS-aware persistence + fallback
- ✅ Production build succeeds
- ✅ No TypeScript compile errors

### Remaining Tasks

#### 1. Run Full Test Suite
**Status**: In Progress (tests started, output incomplete)

**Action**:
```powershell
# In WSL (recommended since npm works there):
npm run test

# Expected: All 9 tests pass
# - contactLead.test.ts (5 tests)
# - contactService.test.ts (4 tests)
```

**Success Criteria**: All tests green, no mock/typing issues

---

#### 2. Start Dev Server & Test Contact Form
**Status**: Blocked by PowerShell execution policy

**Action**:
```powershell
# Option A: Fix PowerShell (Run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
npm run dev

# Option B: Use WSL terminal (already working)
npm run dev
```

**Once server is running**:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/contact
2. Fill form with test data:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Company: "Test Corp"
   - Project: "Test Project"
   - Message: "Testing contact form persistence"
3. Submit and verify:
   - ✅ Success toast shows (from `contact.success_message` in DB)
   - ✅ Check Supabase dashboard → `public.leads` table for new row with `project_source='portfolio'`
   - ✅ Browser console: no errors

**If submission fails**:
- Check network tab: should see POST to Supabase `/rest/v1/leads`
- If RLS error, verify policy constraint matches client payload
- Fallback should trigger edge function call if primary insert fails

#### 3. Validate All Pages Load Data
**Status**: Not Started

**Action**:
With dev server running, visit each route and confirm data renders:

| Route | Expected Data | Verification |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| `/` | Hero + recent projects/artworks | Should show 10 projects, 1 artwork |
| `/portfolio` | Projects, artworks, series grid | Category filters working, 12 total items |
| `/about` | Profile bio, experience, skills | Name, headline, 2+ experience entries |
| `/thoughts` | Blog posts list | 2 thoughts with excerpts |
| `/thoughts/:slug` | Single thought detail | Full body + tags render |
| `/contact` | Form + contact info | Email/LinkedIn/GitHub links from DB |

**Check browser console**: No 400/403/500 errors from Supabase queries

---

#### 4. Address Security Advisories (Optional)
**Status**: Not Started (non-blocking)

**Issue**: Supabase linter flags `SECURITY DEFINER` views as security risks

**Options**:
- **A) Keep as-is** (recommended): Views are intentional for cross-schema access; publishable key limits to SELECT only
- **B) Refactor architecture**: Move all tables to `public` schema, remove `portfolio` schema entirely (breaking change)

**Decision**: Document the architecture choice in `SUPABASE.md` and mark as "by design"

---

#### 5. Final Validation Checklist
**Status**: Not Started

Before marking complete:
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Dev server starts without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Contact form submits and persists to `public.leads`
- [ ] All pages render Supabase data (no empty states)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] TypeScript types aligned with DB schema
- [ ] `VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md` updated with final status

## Quick Start (For You)

### To Complete Implementation:

1. **Run tests** (to verify refactor):
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. **Start dev server** (to test form):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test contact form**:
   - Go to http://localhost:8080/contact
   - Submit test lead
   - Verify in Supabase dashboard: `public.leads` has new row

4. **Browse all pages**:
   - Check /, /portfolio, /about, /thoughts, /contact
   - Confirm data renders from Supabase

5. **Mark complete**:
   - If all above works, implementation is done ✅

## Known Issues

### PowerShell Execution Policy (Windows)
**Symptom**: `npm` commands fail with "execution of scripts was disabled"

**Fix**:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

**Alternative**: Use WSL terminal (npm works there already)

## Architecture Notes

### Why SECURITY DEFINER Views?
- Portfolio data lives in `portfolio` schema (private)
- Anonymous users need read access via `anon` role
- Views in `public` schema with `SECURITY DEFINER` allow cross-schema SELECT without exposing raw tables
- RLS on underlying tables ensures row-level filtering still applies

### Why Two INSERT Policies on leads?
1. **Strict policy**: `project_source='portfolio'` — ensures this app's submissions are tagged
2. **Fallback policy**: `true` — allows other Monynha projects to insert without constraint

Order matters: Postgres evaluates policies with OR logic, so either passes.

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Deploy to Vercel/Netlify**:
   - Set env vars: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`
   - Deploy from `main` branch

2. **Monitor Supabase**:
   - Watch `public.leads` for spam submissions
   - Review RLS logs if legitimate submissions are blocked

3. **Content Updates**:
   - Add more projects/artworks/series via Supabase dashboard
   - Or write a seed script to bulk import from cv.json

4. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add pagination to /thoughts if posts grow
   - Implement search across projects/artworks
   - Add admin dashboard to manage content (if needed)
