## Language handling

The portfolio content is authored in Portuguese. The helper located at `src/lib/language.ts` keeps the `<html lang>` attribute in sync with the visitor preference stored in `localStorage` (`monynha-lang`) and broadcasts updates through the `monynha:languagechange` custom event. The `useCurrentLanguage` hook consumes that event so pages can reactively adjust locale-sensitive elements such as date formatting.

When introducing new locales, extend the `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` tuple inside `src/lib/language.ts` and provide translated copy for the pages and JSON datasets under `public/data/`.

To change the language programmatically you can call:

```ts
import { setLanguage } from '@/lib/language';

setLanguage('pt');
```

## Adding new projects to `cv.json`

Project cards, portfolio thumbnails and extra pages consume the single source of truth located at `public/data/cv.json`.

1. Duplicate an existing entry inside the `projects` array and adjust the fields (`name`, `summary`, `stack`, `url`, `category`, `year`).
2. Create a **vector** thumbnail (SVG only) under `public/images/`. Make sure to include a descriptive `<title>` element for accessibility and keep the canvas 16:9 (640x360 works well).
3. Reference the SVG through the `thumbnail` property (e.g. `"thumbnail": "/images/novo-projeto.svg"`).
4. Run `npm run build` to ensure the bundle stays under budget.

Thoughts, artworks or series follow the same approach: update the JSON and link SVG assetsâ€”no raster formats should be added to the repository.
