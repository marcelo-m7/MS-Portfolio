# Database Migration Audit Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Project:** MS-Portfolio (Monynha Softwares)  
**Objective:** Audit current data structure and prepare Supabase migration from static JSON to database

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Database schema design, migration creation, and testing

Successfully audited the `cv.json` data structure, designed a normalized database schema for the `portfolio` schema in Supabase, created 6 migration files, applied them to the database, and validated with sample data. The database is now ready for data population and frontend integration.

---

## Data Audit Results

### Current Data Source
**File:** `public/data/cv.json` (342 lines)

### Data Types Identified

| Type | Count | Fields | Relationships |
|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| **profile** | 1 | name, headline, location, bio, avatar, langDefault | None (singleton) |
| **projects** | 8 | slug, name, summary, fullDescription, stack[], url, domain, repoUrl, thumbnail, category, status, visibility, year | → stack (array) |
| **experience** | 2 | role, org, start, end, location, highlights[] | → highlights (array) |
| **skills** | 8 | name, category, level | None |
| **series** | 1 | slug, title, description, year, works[] | → works[] (slugs) |
| **artworks** | 1 | slug, title, media[], year, materials[], description, url3d | → media[], materials[] |
| **thoughts** | 2 | slug, date, tags[], title, excerpt, body | → tags[] (array) |
| **contact** | 1 | email, availability, note, successMessage, errorMessage | None (singleton) |

### Key Patterns
- **Slug-based routing** throughout (projects, artworks, thoughts, series)
- **Array fields** need normalization: stack[], media[], materials[], tags[], highlights[], works[]
- **Enum-like fields**: category, status, visibility, level
- **Relationships**: series.works[] references project/artwork slugs
- **No analytics**: No views, likes, or user interaction tracking currently

## Database Schema Design

### Architecture
- **15 tables** in `portfolio` schema
- **Normalized structure** with proper foreign keys
- **RLS enabled** on all tables (public read access)
- **Indexes** on slug fields, dates, and foreign keys
- **Cascade deletes** for child records

### Tables Created

#### Core Tables
1. **`profile`** - Portfolio owner information (singleton)
2. **`contact`** - Contact page configuration (singleton)
3. **`technologies`** - Normalized tech names for reuse

#### Projects
4. **`projects`** - Portfolio projects
5. **`project_stack`** - Many-to-many: projects ↔ technologies

#### Artworks
6. **`artworks`** - Digital art and 3D experiences
7. **`artwork_media`** - Media URLs (ordered)
8. **`artwork_materials`** - Materials/techniques (ordered)

#### Series
9. **`series`** - Collections grouping works
10. **`series_works`** - References to project/artwork slugs

#### Blog
11. **`thoughts`** - Blog posts/reflections
12. **`thought_tags`** - Tags for categorization

#### About
13. **`experience`** - Work history
14. **`experience_highlights`** - Achievements (ordered)
15. **`skills`** - Skills inventory with levels

## Testing & Validation

### Sample Data Inserted

#### Project: BotecoPro
```sql
✅ Project created (slug: boteco-pro)
✅ Technologies linked (Supabase, Flutter, React)
✅ Query test passed: Returns project with tech stack
```

#### Thought: Design Patterns React 2024
```sql
✅ Thought created (slug: design-patterns-react-2024)
✅ Tags added (React, Frontend, Design Patterns)
✅ Query test passed: Returns thought with tags
```

#### Artwork: Art Leo Creative Spaces
```sql
✅ Artwork created (slug: artleo)
✅ Media added (2 URLs in order)
✅ Materials added (Three.js, React Three Fiber, Blender)
✅ Query test passed: Returns artwork with media and materials
```

#### Series: Creative Systems
```sql
✅ Series created (slug: creative-systems)
✅ Works linked (boteco-pro project, artleo artwork)
✅ Query test passed: Returns series with works
```

### Query Examples Validated

All queries return expected JSON structures:
- ✅ Projects with nested stack array
- ✅ Thoughts with nested tags array
- ✅ Artworks with nested media and materials arrays
- ✅ Series with nested works array (slugs + types)

## Migration Strategy (Recommended Phases)

### ✅ Phase 1: Schema Creation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Audit cv.json data structure
- [x] Design normalized schema
- [x] Create migration files
- [x] Apply migrations to Supabase
- [x] Validate with sample data
- [x] Document schema and queries

### 📋 Phase 2: Data Population (Next Steps)
- [ ] Create script to parse cv.json
- [ ] Insert all data into database
- [ ] Verify data integrity
- [ ] Create backup of cv.json (keep as fallback)

### 📋 Phase 3: API Layer
- [ ] Create Supabase client hooks in `src/hooks/`
- [ ] Add React Query integration for caching
- [ ] Create type definitions for database tables
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states

### 📋 Phase 4: Frontend Refactoring
- [ ] Refactor `Portfolio.tsx` to fetch from DB
- [ ] Refactor `ProjectDetail.tsx` to fetch by slug
- [ ] Refactor `Thoughts.tsx` and `ThoughtDetail.tsx`
- [ ] Refactor `About.tsx` (experience, skills)
- [ ] Refactor `SeriesDetail.tsx` and `ArtDetail.tsx`
- [ ] Update `Home.tsx` featured sections

### 📋 Phase 5: CMS & Management
- [ ] Create admin authentication
- [ ] Build content management UI
- [ ] Add image upload support (Supabase Storage)
- [ ] Enable real-time updates
- [ ] Add analytics (views, likes)

## Benefits of Migration

### Current Limitations (cv.json)
- ❌ Requires code deployment for content updates
- ❌ No analytics or user interaction tracking
- ❌ No search/filtering on server side
- ❌ Limited multi-language support
- ❌ No content versioning

### Future Benefits (Database)
- ✅ Real-time content updates without deployment
- ✅ Analytics tracking (views, likes, shares)
- ✅ Server-side search and filtering
- ✅ Multi-language content via separate rows/tables
- ✅ Content versioning and history
- ✅ CMS for non-technical content management
- ✅ Better SEO with dynamic meta tags
- ✅ API for external integrations

---

## Technical Specifications

### Database
- **Provider:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Schema:** `portfolio`
- **Tables:** 15
- **Indexes:** 25+
- **RLS:** Enabled on all tables
- **Triggers:** 6 update_updated_at triggers

### Relationships
- **Many-to-Many:** projects ↔ technologies (via project_stack)
- **One-to-Many:** artworks → media, artworks → materials
- **One-to-Many:** experience → highlights
- **One-to-Many:** thoughts → tags
- **Slug References:** series_works → projects/artworks (by slug)

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Unique constraints on slugs
- ✅ Check constraints (level, work_type)
- ✅ NOT NULL constraints on required fields
- ✅ Cascade deletes for child records

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Backup cv.json** - Keep as source of truth until migration complete
2. **Document API contracts** - Define expected response shapes
3. **Set up staging environment** - Test with production data copy

### Best Practices
- Use TypeScript types generated from database schema
- Implement React Query for caching and optimistic updates
- Add error boundaries for database failures
- Keep cv.json as fallback (graceful degradation)
- Version migrations with timestamps

### Future Enhancements
- Add full-text search (PostgreSQL tsvector)
- Implement content versioning (audit log)
- Add multi-language support (separate locale tables)
- Enable real-time subscriptions (Supabase Realtime)
- Add image optimization pipeline (Supabase Storage + CDN)

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Database foundation is solid and ready for data population.

The portfolio schema is well-designed, normalized, and tested. All relationships work correctly, and queries return expected structures. The migration path is clear with 5 defined phases.

**Next step:** Create data population scripts to migrate cv.json content into the database.
